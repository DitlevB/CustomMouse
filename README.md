# Custom Lightweight Mouse

<br/> 
This is how I made a lightweight 3D printed mouse by using the internals from a Razer Mamba Wireless. 
The idea for the project started from a YouTube video by OptimumTech and his process of developing the Zeromouse.
<br/> 

**Goal for the project**
I wanted to create a lightweight wireless mouse which was specifically tailored to my ergonomics and to save weight, only with material where I usually grip my mouse.<br/> 

**Getting the internals**
I had to get the internals for the mouse, which I ended up salvaging from a Razer Mamba Wireless I got second hand. To begin, I measured the dimensions of the PCB, the USB daughterboard and the placement of both sensor and switches. 
These were all modeled in Fusion360 and served as constraints which the design would be based around.<br/>

**Developing the shell**
With the dimensions of the internals ready, I could model the shell of the mouse. To determine optimized ergonomics, a baloon of flour was used which I moulded to a pleasant shape. This shape was roughly measured and transfered onto the 3D model of the mouse shell. To determine my fingergrip placement, I measured the wear spots on my daily mouse which was incorporated into the 3D model as well, with lastly the unused surface being removed<br/> 
A few iterations of this process was made usng FDM 3D printers while also refining the tolerances for PCB mounting spots and sensor lense interface.<br/>

**Final version**
I was fortunate enough to have access to SLA printers at the time where I could print the final version. This was the final result:<br/>
